# Sorbet Helper

Celeste mod with whatever entities, triggers, etc. I make.

## Currently includes the following additions:

## Entities:

### Kill Zone
Kills the player when touched, can also be flag toggled.

### Strawberry (With Return)
Acts like a vanilla `Strawberry`, but when the player collects it, they are put into a bubble and moved along a series of nodes, once they reach the end of the nodes, the bubble will pop.

There is also a winged vesion.

*Note: This entity is NOT compatible with strawberry seeds.*

### Flag Toggled Killbox
Same as the vanilla `Killbox` entity, except it can also be flag toggled.
